## Setup and Installations

- `yarn start` - Runs the app in the development mode on [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000).
- `yarn build` - Builds the app for production to the `build` folder.
- `yarn eject` - If you aren’t satisfied with the build tool and configuration choices, you can `eject` at any time. This command will remove the single build dependency from your project. [_Note: this is a one-way operation. Once you `eject`, you can’t go back!_]
