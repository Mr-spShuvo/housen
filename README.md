## Setup and Installations

To run the project locally you have to install Nodejs version 10+. Clone the project and run `yarn install` from the root directory to install all the dependencies for the project. This project depends on environment variables. Rename the `.env.example` files to `.env` and set `REACT_APP_API_ENDPOINT_URL` variable to your values. These following commands are available.

- `yarn start` - Runs the app in the development mode on [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000).
- `yarn build` - Builds the app for production to the `build` folder.
- `yarn eject` - If you arenâ€™t satisfied with the build tool and configuration choices, you can `eject` at any time. This command will remove the single build dependency from your project. [_Note: this is a one-way operation. Once you `eject`, you canâ€™t go back!_]
